    "2. FOR BATCH ANALYSIS (Accuracy Priority):\n",
    "   → Use {best_f1['Model']} for accurate insights\n",
    "   → Run overnight on 500K+ emails\n",
    "   → Leverage GPU acceleration for speed boost\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HYBRID APPROACH (Recommended):\n",
    "   → Real-time: {best_speed['Model']} for live filtering\n",
    "   → Deep analysis: {best_f1['Model']} for weekly reports\n",
    "   → Ensemble: Average predictions for critical decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. COST OPTIMIZATION:\n",
    "   → Cloud API (GPT-4, Claude): $0.50-2.00 per 1M tokens\n",
    "   → Self-hosted transformer: $0.10-0.30 per 1M tokens (GPU)\n",
    "   → Lexicon models (VADER/TextBlob): <$0.01 per 1M tokens\n",
